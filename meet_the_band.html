		<p style="font-family: 'Amatic SC', cursive; font-size: 30"> The Father Blueberries are a local band from Boston Massachusetts that originated in 2014.  Sophomore year in their college dorm room Nick and CJ started playing guitar together. Meanwhile, with Albert on vocals and CJ on drums, the two completed a RockBand campaign as the Father BlueBerries, and the name was born. Albert joined CJ and Nick adding vocals to their acoustic jam sessions. It wasâ€™t long before they were searching for a drummer. While on the hunt the band adopted Chuck as a permanent fixture of the Father BlueBerries. Jo picked up the sticks for the band only weeks before their first performance. With the band fully realized they hit the stage time and time again with a presence all their own! </p>
